### Defining the Problem 
My client is currently facing a problem of having to think of what to cook for every meal; breakfast, lunch and dinner, for her family. Especially in the current situtation of covid-19 pandemic, everyone in her family member now stays in the house for the whole day, therefore she needs to cook three meals for the whole family member. My client is in need for something that can help her with coming up with different menus for every meal. She doesn't want to cook the same thing everyday, although she is having trouble coming up with non-repetitive menus. Furthermore, she also wants her family to eat healthily, with balanced nutrition.
